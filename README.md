restaurant. It gives them ample amount of description about food items in menu with
visuals to help customers decide there order with ease. It gives add to cart option so that
bulk orders can be made. This website has also been made keeping in mind the needs of
the restaurant administration as well. The admin section of the website is very
informative and has a easy to understand interface to make it easy for administration to
manage tasks. They can insert or delete products from menu, view details of customer
who reserved seat and who orders online. There is also a message area where customer
queries or complains can be addressed.

## 	Performance analysis

Overall site performance is good, it is easy to use and visually appealing. It enables
user to select items easily , reserve tables and makes queries or complaints. On the other
hand it makes the work of administrative staff easier and efficient by displaying a no. of
information in a simple yet descriptive manner.

Although it still lacks some features like absence of payment gateway, the reservation
doesn't updates day wise i.e old reservation are still visible after date passes etc we
would like to address al those issues in future work.
